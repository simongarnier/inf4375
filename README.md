# inf4375-simple-server

a simple web server in clojure for my delightful web class

## Installation and usage
You'll need [Clojure](http://clojure.org/getting_started) and [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/#install) to run this thing. Once you're up and running just :

    $ lein run [port]

Where port is the port number you want the server to listen on. Defaults to 8080.
